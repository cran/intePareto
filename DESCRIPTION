Description: Integrative analysis of gene expression (RNA-Seq data), and histone 
	modification data for user-defined sets of histone marks (ChIP-Seq data) to 
	discover consistent changes in genes between biological conditions. 
	Additionally, Pareto optimization is used to prioritize genes based on the 
	level of consistent changes in both RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data. 
	Method is described in Cao, Y. et al. (2020) <doi:10.1186/s12864-020-07205-6>.
