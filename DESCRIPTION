Description: Integrative analysis of gene expression (RNA-Seq data), and histone 
    modification data for user-defined sets of histone marks (ChIP-Seq data) to 
    discover consistent changes in genes between biological conditions. 
    Additionally, Pareto optimization is used to prioritize genes based on the 
    level of consistent changes in both RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data.
